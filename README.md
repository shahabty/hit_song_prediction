# Hit Song Prediction
This repo contains implementations of random forest, support vector machine, and neural network for hit song prediction in Pytorch and Sklearn.

### Installation
1. Install Anaconda3.

2. Run the following commands to create conda environment and install all dependencies:

```console
username@PC:~$ conda env create -f environment.yml
